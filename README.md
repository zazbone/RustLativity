# RustLativity

A crate that attempt to provide tools for special relativity computation.
This crate will not help to solve problem them self but provide mathematics and physics
tools for solving it.

## Advancement
Currently having ~~hard time~~ fun with generics type

Final objectiv is to cover most of tools like Lorentz Matrix or quadrivector.... . Also physics properties and representation like Minkowski diagrams.
Limited by whitch ones is contained in [special relativity Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity)

## Build
Stability will not be garanted until first release, because the crate not contain enouth features to be considered as stable.
