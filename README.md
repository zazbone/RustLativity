# RustLativity

A crate that attempt to provide tools for special relativity computation.
This crate will not help to solve problem them self but provide mathematics and physics
tools for solving it.

## Advancement
Currently having ~~hard time~~ fun with generics type

Final objectiv is to cover most of tools like Lorentz Matrix or quadrivector.... . Also physics properties and representation like Minkowski diagrams.
Limited by whitch ones is contained in [special relativity Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity)

## Build
Current build status is fail, (current commit litterally fail to build).
Stability will not be garanted until first release, because the crate not contain enouth features to be considered as stable.
